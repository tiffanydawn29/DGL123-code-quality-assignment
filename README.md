Code Quality Assignment  

*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." – Martin Fowler*  

What is code quality?  

Code Quality is a term that developers use to determine whether the code that has been written is good or bad. It’s essentially a standard that they go by.
While different people will differ on some of the factors, most of the determining factors are similar.  
Why is code quality so important?
As a developer the chances of you being the only one to look at the code you are building are very slim. You are going to need other sets of eyes on a project, just as you would send a piece of writing to an editor developers need to do the same thing. What you are writing may only be for yourself OR many developers could be working on the same project at the same time, so having a good set of standards in place is a good idea and best practice. It helps everyone understand what they are seeing so no one is wasting time trying to track someone down to figure out what they meant. It can also make the software you are building function better, run with better efficiency and be safer for all users.
The following are a few articles I have found and the different points each article makes on what they believe quality code really is.
